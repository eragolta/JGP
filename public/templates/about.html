	<p>J.G.P. Engineering Group P.A. was founded in 1972 assembling a team of engineers and related professionals dedicated to the design of safe, efficient, and viable Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing (MEP) Systems for new and renovated projects.  It has been the policy of our Firm that all projects regardless of its size, be under the direct responsibility of one of its Principals.  This personal attention assures a prompt and accurate response to our client’s needs and the successful completion of each project.</p>

<p>The MEP Design projects carried out by our Firm have been diverse in type, scope, and jurisdictions.  Our vast experience in hospitality, commercial office buildings, correction facilities, hospitals, educational, and residential projects, has enabled us to offer a responsible MEP Design for our most demanding clients.  We have grown to become a leader in the MEP Design field serving customers from the Mainland U.S.A., the Caribbean, and South America, from our two offices located in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Miami, Florida.  Our designs cover diversified projects such as the 2000 Bed Correctional Facility for Wackenhut Corrections Corporation in Lawton, Oklahoma; the Barclays Headquarters Office Building and J.W. Marriott Hotel Complex in Downtown Miami, Florida; the Outpatient Clinic Addition to the Veterans Administration Hospital in San Juan, Puerto Rico; the Saint Croix Educational Complex in the U.S. Virgin Islands; and the Puerto Rico Pavilion at the International World’s Fair of 1992 in Seville, Spain. Our Firm is ready to tackle the MEP Design needs of the most demanding projects and customers anywhere in the world.</p>

<p>Our MEP Design starts with a thorough evaluation and a life cycle cost analysis of each project to give us the needed information to select the most appropriate systems for each project.  This process allows us to achieve a conscious design that takes into account first cost, operating cost, and maintenance cost, for the benefit of our Projects Owner’s.  Our services span from schematic, design-development, construction documents, and contract administration phases of work for the MEP disciplines, and include the following:  Central HVAC Systems, Smoke Engineering Systems, Plumbing, Fire Sprinklers, Medical Gases, Industrial Process Piping, Compressed Air, Electrical Distribution, Fire Alarm, and other specialties.  Because of our experience and background in the Electrical and Mechanical Contracting field, we can provide project design estimates, change order evaluation, and turnkey design/built for MEP systems for a variety of projects.</p> 

<p>Our best references are not only our successful existing projects but the repeated business that we receive from our clients.  This is testimony of their complete satisfaction with our performance.</p>
